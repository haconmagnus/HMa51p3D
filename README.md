# HMa51p3D By Hacon Magnus
Prepar3d v5 Multiplayer scenario , 8 player slots,Located at Area 51 in Nevada.
This is just a very basic sandbox multiplayer mission.
There are various aircraft on the tarmac that can be piloted.

Even a trailer with a Campfire and a couple of chairs for test pilots to hang out at.

***Hostile AI***
There are four F16C Blank that are airborne piloted by AI a group of 3 
and a single Pilot (Mitch)flying Blue Camo F16 they are hostile to one of the parked F16 on the Tarmac, 
marked "experimental 2" inside of the sim editor. They may also attack other aircraft.

There is also a commercial aircraft in the sim that is airborn. 

I am still learning simdirector so consider this a WIP, I make no claim to be an expert and there is likely better ways to code the sim
However the logic contained here is doing what I set it out to do so future works will only get better.
